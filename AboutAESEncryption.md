Seeing as this was a class project, we decided it would be cool to hand code AES encryption in order to get a better understand of how it works.  Now that it works and we learned a lot, I plan on switching over to Java's crypto library.  In the mean time, I wouldn't trust our version of AES for anything too sensitive.
