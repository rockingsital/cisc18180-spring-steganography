Ron, Kyle, and Steve's steganography project for CISC181.  We successfully completed the desktop version, but we were unable to complete the Android version.  We were unable to get Android to read and write uncompressed PNGs.  Further development will be limited.

Check the wiki for more info on our design choices etc.
